# MyCouch.AspNet.Identity #

**PROJECT ARCHIVED** not maintaining this repo anymore.

A simple implementation of the new ASP.Net identity provider model for handling authentication and authorization in e.g. ASP.Net MVC5 using CouchDb or Cloudant as storage.

Uses [MyCouch - The asynchronous CouchDb and Cloudant client for .Net](https://github.com/danielwertheim/mycouch).

## NuGet ##
MyCouch.AspNet.Identity is distributed via NuGet. You can [find the CouchDb package here](https://nuget.org/packages/MyCouch.AspNet.Identity/). But basically, in any .Net4.0, .Net4.5 or Windows Store app project, open up the Package manager console, and invoke:

    pm:> install-package mycouch.aspnet.identity

**Please note!** Some users with old versions of NuGet has reported that some dependencies might not be resolved. The solution is to update NuGet.

## Get up and running with the source ##
Please note. **No NuGet packages are checked in**. If you are using the latest version of NuGet (v2.7.1+) you should be able to just build and the packages will be restored. If this does not work, you could install the missing NuGet packages using the provided PowerShell script:

    ps:> .\setup-devenv.ps1

or

    cmd:> powershell -executionpolicy unrestricted .\setup-devenv.ps1

For the script to work, you need to have [the NuGet command line](http://nuget.codeplex.com/releases) `(NuGet.exe) registrered in the environment path`, or you need to tweak the script so it knows where it will find your NuGet.exe.
